# Datasets
Two Commonly used datasets were used in this paper, namely Flevoland and San Francisco 
Flevoland dataset can be downloaded from:
https://github.com/mqalkhatib/SDF2Net/tree/main/Datasets/Flevoland

# Requirement
Python 3.9.18, Tensorflow (and Keras) 2.10.0, cvnn 2.0, Tensorflow Probability 0.18.0

# Results
o quantitatively measure the proposed HybridCVNet model, three evaluation metrics are employed to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm, including Overall Accuracy (OA), Average Accuracy (AA) and Cohen's Kappa (k). Also, Each class accuracy has been reported

Model was qualitatively evaluated by visually comparing the resulting class maps.
